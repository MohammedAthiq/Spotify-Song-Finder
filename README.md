# Spotify-Song-Finder
Spotify Song Finder is a Python CLI tool that allows you to search for songs on Spotify using just a line of lyrics. It fetches track info using the Spotify Web API and returns the song title, artist, and a direct Spotify link. Built as a personal learning project to explore real-world API integration.
